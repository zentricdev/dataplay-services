# Dataplay Services

## Data Generator
The Data Generator service provides a flexible way to generate mock data based on a defined schema. It is useful for seeding databases, creating data for tests, or any other scenario where you need to generate structured data.

## Data Sync Engine
The Data Sync Engine service is used to create hashes from data payloads to verify data integrity and detect changes. It can be used to synchronize data between different systems by comparing the hashes of the data payloads.

## Query Log
The Query Log service logs all database queries executed by the application to a log file. It can be used for debugging, performance analysis, or auditing database activity. The service can be enabled or disabled on the fly.
