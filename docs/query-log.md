# Query Log

`QueryLog` is a minimalist service for logging all SQL queries executed by the application to a log file. Its main advantage is simplicity and the absence of heavy dependencies, offering a lightweight alternative to more comprehensive tools.

## Main Features

- **Lightweight and Simple:** It focuses solely on logging SQL queries without overloading the application with additional functionality.
- **Zero External Dependencies:** It does not require the installation of complex packages, which may not be ideal for production environments or for quick, specific analysis.
- **Dynamic Activation and Deactivation:** It can be enabled or disabled at runtime, allowing precise control over when queries should be logged.
- **Plain File Output:** Queries are saved in a log file (`dataplay-queries.log`), facilitating their review with standard command-line tools like `cat`, `grep`, or `tail`.

## Use Case

It is ideal for scenarios where a quick audit of SQL queries is needed without the overhead of a full user interface. For example, during the execution of integration tests, `seeders`, or `backend` processes where only the queries generated by Eloquent or other database components need to be verified.

## Basic Usage

To start logging, simply enable the service:

```php
use DataPlay\Facades\QueryLog;

// Enable logging
QueryLog::enable();

// ... execute application logic ...

// Disable logging
QueryLog::disable();
```

Logged queries will be found in the file defined in the `dataplay.services.querylog.path` configuration.
